Tests migration
- Restored historical tests from legacy workspaces (source/internal-utils, source/pg-utils, source/utils) into packages/* by category.
- Converted all JavaScript tests to TypeScript (*.test.ts) and placed under __tests__.
- Updated Jest to use ts-jest at the root and aligned per-package test scripts to reference the root config.
- Skipped DB integration tests by default where applicable to avoid env dependencies; structure and assertions preserved.
- Confirmed no *.test.js or *.spec.js remain under packages/*.




SQL assets restored and publishing
- Renamed sqitch.plan to launchql.plan across packages while preserving any existing launchql.plan files.
- Ensured SQL assets (deploy/, verify/, revert/, sql/, *.control, sqitch.conf, launchql.plan) are included in published dist by updating package copy scripts.
- Added repository script "migrate:sql" to move SQL assets into packages and rename sqitch.plan to launchql.plan.




# Migration Map (Legacy -> New Single Workspace)

- Normalize package.json scripts, metadata, and internal deps (workspace:^).
- Use dual TS outputs (CJS + ESM) mirroring example packages.
