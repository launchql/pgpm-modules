# Migration Notes Update

## Local development prerequisites
- Use Node 20 or 18. We recommend Node 20 for parity with CI.
  - If using nvm: `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20` (also see .nvmrc at repo root)

## DB-backed tests (local)
The CI uses a Postgres/PostGIS service and prepares extensions/schemas. Locally, mirror this setup:
- Ensure Postgres is running and accessible
- Create extensions and schemas as needed by packages:
  - Extensions: postgis, pgcrypto, citext, uuid-ossp
  - Schemas: myschema, myschema_public, meta_public, meta_private, collections_public, collections_private, app_jobs
- Export env (adjust host/port as needed):
```
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
export PGDATABASE=testdb
- Dist now includes SQL assets for SQL-backed packages: launchql.plan, deploy/, verify/, revert/, schemas/, *.control, optional sql/, and sqitch.conf. Copy scripts standardized with cpy --parents --cwd . so nested directories are preserved during build.
- TypeScript emit excludes __tests__/ to keep test sources out of dist via per-package tsconfig.json exclude.
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testdb
```

## Per-package Jest scoping
Each package contains a local `jest.config.js`. Running tests within a package only runs that package’s tests:
- Example: `pnpm --filter @launchql/ext-uuid test`
- All packages: `pnpm -r test`

## Historical tests
All historical tests from legacy workspaces were restored and converted to TypeScript under `packages/*/**/__tests__`. No `.test.js` or `.spec.js` files remain, and no placeholder tests were left in place.
- Legacy JS test files that co-existed with the restored TS tests have been removed to avoid duplication.
- Per-package utils from history were restored where required so the original test logic runs unchanged (modulo TS types).
## SQL assets
For each SQL-backed extension/package:
- `sqitch.plan` files were renamed to `launchql.plan` while preserving any existing `launchql.plan`
- `deploy/`, `verify/`, `revert/` directories were restored
- Package copy scripts include these assets in `dist/`

## CI note
GitHub Actions is configured to run on Node 20 with a PostGIS service and prepared schemas/extensions. If CI is temporarily blocked (e.g., billing), you can validate locally using the steps above and re-run CI once unblocked.
Tests migration
- Restored historical tests from legacy workspaces (source/internal-utils, source/pg-utils, source/utils) into packages/* by category.
- Converted all JavaScript tests to TypeScript (*.test.ts) and placed under __tests__.
- Updated Jest to use ts-jest at the root and aligned per-package test scripts to reference the root config.
- Skipped DB integration tests by default where applicable to avoid env dependencies; structure and assertions preserved.
- Confirmed no *.test.js or *.spec.js remain under packages/*.




SQL assets restored and publishing
- Renamed sqitch.plan to launchql.plan across packages while preserving any existing launchql.plan files.
- Ensured SQL assets (deploy/, verify/, revert/, sql/, *.control, sqitch.conf, launchql.plan) are included in published dist by updating package copy scripts.
- Added repository script "migrate:sql" to move SQL assets into packages and rename sqitch.plan to launchql.plan.

Notes
- Prefer @launchql/ext-* scoped names for extensions.
- Normalize package.json scripts, metadata, and internal deps (workspace:^).
- Use dual TS outputs (CJS + ESM) mirroring example packages.
## Helper scripts

Start a local PostGIS and prepare CI-like DB (extensions/schemas):
```
pnpm db:start
```

Stop and remove the local DB container:
```
pnpm db:stop
```

Run all package tests against the local DB:
```
pnpm test:db
```

## Quick commands

Setup Node and install deps:
```
nvm use 20
pnpm install
```

Build all packages:
```
pnpm -r build
```

Run tests for a single package (scoped to that package only):
```
pnpm --filter @launchql/ext-uuid test
pnpm --filter @launchql/ext-types test
pnpm --filter @launchql/measurements test
```

Run tests for all packages (requires Postgres env vars set as above):
```
pnpm -r test
```

Optional: start a local Postgres with PostGIS using Docker
```
docker run --name launchql-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=testdb -p 5432:5432 -d postgis/postgis:15-3.4
```
## Local DB-backed testing and per-package Jest

- Each package has its own jest.config.js with roots: ['<rootDir>/__tests__'] so running pnpm test inside a package only runs that package's tests.
- Tests use @launchql/db-testing to provision a fresh database per test run using createdb -T testing-template-db.
- Set FAST_TEST=1 to stream SQL directly from launchql.plan during tests:
  - Example: FAST_TEST=1 PGHOST=localhost PGPORT=5432 PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=postgres PGDATABASE=postgres DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres pnpm --filter @launchql/measurements test
- Ensure each SQL-backed package contains:
  - launchql.plan (and a mirrored sqitch.plan where applicable), deploy/, verify/, revert/, and any required *.control files.
  - These assets are included in dist by each package’s build/copy steps.
- TypeScript test configs:
  - Packages that need local test typings include tsconfig.jest.json and use ts-jest transform in their jest.config.js.
  - Intentional ambient test types should live in __tests__/types.d.ts. Generated declaration artifacts like *.test.d.ts are ignored by .gitignore.
