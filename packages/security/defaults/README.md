# @pgpm/defaults

Security defaults and baseline configurations.

## Overview

`@pgpm/defaults` establishes a secure baseline configuration for PostgreSQL databases by revoking default public access. This package implements the principle of least privilege by removing PostgreSQL's default permissive settings and requiring explicit permission grants.

## Features

- **Revoke Public Database Access**: Removes default PUBLIC access to databases
- **Restrict Function Execution**: Prevents PUBLIC from executing functions by default
- **Lock Down Public Schema**: Removes CREATE privilege on public schema from PUBLIC
- **Secure by Default**: Forces explicit permission grants
- **One-Time Setup**: Applies baseline security configuration

## Installation

If you have `pgpm` installed:

```bash
pgpm install @pgpm/defaults
pgpm deploy
```

This is a quick way to get started. The sections below provide more detailed installation options.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install pgpm globally
npm install -g pgpm

# Start PostgreSQL
pgpm docker start

# Set environment variables
eval "$(pgpm env)"
```

### Deploy

#### Option 1: Deploy by installing with pgpm

```bash
pgpm install @pgpm/defaults
pgpm deploy
```

#### Option 2: Deploy from Package Directory

```bash
cd packages/security/defaults
pgpm deploy --createdb
```

#### Option 3: Deploy from Workspace Root

```bash
# Install workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# Deploy with dependencies
pgpm deploy mydb1 --yes --createdb
```

## What It Does

This package executes three critical security operations:

### 1. Revoke Database Access from PUBLIC

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE current_database FROM PUBLIC;
```

Removes all default privileges that PUBLIC role has on the database, preventing unauthorized access.

### 2. Revoke Function Execution from PUBLIC

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC;
```

Prevents PUBLIC from executing any functions by default. Functions must be explicitly granted to roles.

### 3. Revoke Schema Creation from PUBLIC

```sql
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

Prevents PUBLIC from creating objects in the public schema, requiring explicit permissions.

## Usage

### Deploying Security Defaults

This is typically one of the first packages you deploy to establish a secure baseline.

#### From Package Directory

```bash
cd packages/security/defaults
pgpm deploy --createdb
```

#### From Workspace Root

```bash
pgpm install
pgpm deploy mydb1 --yes --createdb
```

### After Deployment

After deploying this package, you must explicitly grant permissions:

```sql
-- Grant database connection to specific roles
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO authenticated;

-- Grant schema usage
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- Grant table access
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON my_table TO authenticated;

-- Grant function execution
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION my_function() TO authenticated;
```

## Security Model

### Before @pgpm/defaults

PostgreSQL's default configuration is permissive:
- PUBLIC can connect to databases
- PUBLIC can execute functions
- PUBLIC can create objects in public schema

This is convenient for development but insecure for production.

### After @pgpm/defaults

All access must be explicitly granted:
- Roles need CONNECT privilege to access database
- Roles need USAGE privilege on schemas
- Roles need specific privileges on tables/functions
- No implicit permissions exist

## Integration with Other Packages

### With @pgpm/default-roles

```bash
# Deploy both packages from their directories
cd packages/security/defaults && pgpm deploy --createdb
cd packages/security/default-roles && pgpm deploy --createdb
```

Then grant permissions to roles:

```sql
-- Grant permissions to roles
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO anonymous, authenticated, administrator;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anonymous, authenticated, administrator;
```

### With Application Tables

```sql
-- Create table
CREATE TABLE users (id uuid PRIMARY KEY, email text);

-- Explicitly grant access (nothing is granted by default)
GRANT SELECT ON users TO anonymous;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON users TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON users TO administrator;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Deploy Early**: Apply this package before creating application objects
2. **Explicit Grants**: Always explicitly grant required permissions
3. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions needed
4. **Document Grants**: Keep track of what permissions each role has
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify that your application works with restricted permissions

## Common Patterns

### Public Read, Authenticated Write

```sql
-- Public data that anyone can read
GRANT SELECT ON public_data TO anonymous;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public_data TO authenticated;
```

### Private User Data

```sql
-- Enable RLS for user isolation
ALTER TABLE user_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Only authenticated users can access their own data
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON user_data TO authenticated;

CREATE POLICY user_data_policy ON user_data
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = jwt_public.current_user_id());
```

### Admin-Only Tables

```sql
-- Only administrators can access
GRANT ALL ON admin_config TO administrator;
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Errors

If you see permission denied errors after deploying this package:

1. Check which role is being used: `SELECT current_role;`
2. Verify role has CONNECT: `SELECT has_database_privilege('rolename', 'mydb', 'CONNECT');`
3. Verify schema USAGE: `SELECT has_schema_privilege('rolename', 'public', 'USAGE');`
4. Grant missing permissions explicitly

### Functions Not Executable

If functions can't be executed:

```sql
-- Grant execute on specific function
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION my_function() TO authenticated;

-- Or grant execute on all functions in schema
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
```

## Development

### **Before You Begin**

```bash
# 1. Install pgpm
npm install -g pgpm

# 2. Start Postgres (Docker or local)
pgpm docker start

# 3. Load PG* environment variables (PGHOST, PGUSER, ...)
eval "$(pgpm env)"
```

---

### **Starting a New Project**

```bash
# 1. Create a workspace
pgpm init --workspace
cd my-app

# 2. Create your first module
pgpm init

# 3. Add a migration
pgpm add some_change

# 4. Deploy (auto-creates database)
pgpm deploy --createdb
```

---

### **Working With an Existing Project**

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone <repo> && cd <project>

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install
